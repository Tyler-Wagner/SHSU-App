    Figure out who will be dealing with the database mainly
        This will include the security of it
    
    Someone gets ready to answer all questions that Islam will ask

Frontend:
    Functional buttons

Backend:
    Need to choose a database
    Figure out what we need to store in te database
        OAuth keys for blackboard
        Usernames
        Passwords
    Set up the hash code so we can safely store usernames and Passwords

Security:
    Hash everything locally we do not want to send the real passwords to the database
        Use Kyber Encryption with DH key exchange to make sure we have the same keys
            Kyber encryption is just AES256^2 (it wraps the key within a hash)
    Disable any way to ssh into the database unless it is going through a secure port
        Might want to write a script on the database side to handle any weird incoming connections
        Auto shutdown if it gets DoS'ed?
