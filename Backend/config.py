# I need to work on this at some point in the near future
# all this will do is allow us to read and create config files
# specific to each user
# might need to call this in the settings area but im not 100% sure
# This will be a WIP for a while honestly


# This class will allow the users to upload their own custom config files
# there needs to be clear documentation on this however for the user
